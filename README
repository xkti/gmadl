gmadl - garry's mod addon downloader script
written in bash, released under public domain/cc0

runs best on linux, wsl works too.
requires depotdownloader[1], bash, jq, curl, wget

what it does:
 - allows batch downloading of addons and collections[0]
     ./download-addon.sh 2193997180 232539187 3039181160
     ./download-collection.sh 355803678
 - metadata scraping and saving
     saves images*, json, and human-readable info
     saves youtube ids as well, but doesn't download them
 - logs successful downloads to a text file
    so it won't redownload up to date addons

made in response to the nintendo addon massacre, i hope this tool
will be of use to others in order to preserve content from here on out.
although designed specifically for gmod, this script can easily be
modified to work with other games (assuming they are supported.)

[0] - collection downloader only downloads the addons and their respective
      metadata, it does not save anything about the collection itself.
[1] - depotdownloader *must* be in the same directory as these scripts.
[2] - steam servers may return a file with no filename, which wget will
      save as index.html. the logic to handle this issue is complicated,
      so this will be dealt with at a later time. apologies.
